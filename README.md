# Contact-Book-App
The goal is to create an application that allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete contact information. The app should provide a user-friendly interface for managing a personal or business contact list. 
Contact Operations:
* Add: Prompts the user for name, phone number, email, and address.
* View: Displays all stored contacts.
* Update: Allows the user to update details of a specific contact.
* Delete: Deletes a contact from the contact book.
* Search: Finds a contact by name.

Future Improvements:
1. Add validation for email and phone number formats.
2. Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
3. Use a GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter) to make the app more user-friendly.
